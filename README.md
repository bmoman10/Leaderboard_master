# Leaderboard

The leaderboard is an interactive scoreboard that displays scores of either individual assigments or totals for all students in a specified course. Below is a screenshot of what to expect when using the leaderboard.

First you'll notice two drop down menus.

Start by selecting the course and under the "column" drop down menu on the right you'll select either "total" or an individual assignment.

Just below the drop down menus the course information is displayed with information on the selected course's term as well as the number of students enrolled.

A bar graph is displayed for the selected course and assignment.

The bars represent individual students scores compared to other students.

To display the student associated with a specific bar, simply click on the bar and the student's information will be displayed below.

# Motivation

This was our first experience working together as part of a group using the agile process scrum. We were tasked with adding 7 features over the semester. We successfully passed all tests given and recieved and A for this project.
